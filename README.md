Project Details: This analysis was done as part of the 2nd project in the Practical Data Science program I am attending (02-2023); 
The focus of this assignment was to use python packages to perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis); 
For this, I analyzed the results published by Arnaud Philippot et. al 2022: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108165; 
To run this analysis we received a consent and the data from the authors representative(s). 
Briefly, The authors "data article provides a dataset of psychological scores, additional description of used measures, and descriptive data of participants 
related to the research article entitled “Impact of physical exercise on depression and anxiety in adolescent inpatients: a randomized controlled trial” (Philippot et al., 2022)" 
In my analysis I made use of several Python Packages to explore, present and statistically compare the major findings of my analysis; 
The code and PPTX files describe the major findings of this analysis.
